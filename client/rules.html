    <h1 class="h">Tank Tactics</h1>
    <p>
        Tank Tactics is an implementation of the game "Tank Turn Tactics" from <a href="https://youtu.be/t9WMNuyjm4w">this GDC talk</a>. I made it as close as possible to the game described in the talk, so I recommend watching it and learning the rules
        that way. For the people who don't want to do that, I have this guide for them.
    </p>
    <div id="Stats">
        <h2 class="h">Stats</h2>
        <p>
            Each player has 3 stats. They are the following:
        </p>
        <h3 id="HP" class="h"><i class="stat-icon fas fa-heart"></i>Health (HP)</h3>
        <p>
            Health (or HP) is the amount of health a player has left. Every player starts with 3 Health. You can <a href="#Attacking">attack</a> players to lower their HP. HP can not be healed. Once a player's HP drops to 0, they join <a href="#Jury">the Jury</a>            and are no longer able to interact with other players.
        </p>
        <h3 id="AP" class="h"><i class="stat-icon fas fa-bolt"></i>Action Points (AP)</h3>
        <p>
            Action points (or AP) are used to <a href="#Actions">do everything in this game</a>. Every player starts with one. You can give AP to other players. Once every in-game day, every alive player gets one more AP. You can also obtain AP through
            <a href="#Jury">the Jury</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Range" class="h"><i class="stat-icon fas fa-bullseye"></i>Range</h3>
        <p>
            Range is the distance where you can't interact with players further than that distance. Every player's range starts at 2. Range can be <a href="#Upgrading_Range">upgraded</a>. You can see your range as the yellow squares around you.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Actions">
        <h2 class="h">Actions</h2>
        <p>
            There are 4 actions that are able to do in the game, and they are the following:
        </p>
        <h3 id="Moving" class="h">ü°Ü Moving</h3>
        <p>
            Moving is changing your position. You are able to move one square in any direction (without the diagonals) per <a href="#AP">AP</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Attacking" class="h">‚öîÔ∏è Attacking</h3>
        <p>
            Attacking is reducing another player's <a href="#HP">HP</a>. You can only attack in your <a href="#Range">range</a>. You remove one HP from your opponent per <a href="#AP">AP</a> used.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Giving_AP" class="h">‚úã Giving AP</h3>
        <p>
            You can give <a href="#AP">AP</a> to players in your range. You give 1 AP per AP.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Upgrading_Range" class="h">‚óé Upgrading Your Range</h3>
        <p>
            You can upgrade your <a href="#Range">range</a>. You increase your range by 1 for every 2 <a href="#AP">AP</a> used.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Jury">
        <h2 class="h">The Jury</h2>
        <p>
            When a player dies, they join the jury. Everyone in the jury votes every 24 hours and when the vote ends, every player with 3+ votes gets one extra <a href="#AP">AP</a>. If you don't vote, your vote will be wasted.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Spectating">
        <h2 class="h">Spectating</h2>
        <p>
            You can spectate. This means watching the game without being logged in. You can do that <a href="/spectate.html">here</a>.
