# tank-tactics
Tank Tactics is an implementation of the game "Tank Turn Tactics" from [this GDC talk](https://youtu.be/t9WMNuyjm4w). I made it as close as possible to the game described in the talk, so I recommend watching it and learning the rules that way. For the people who don't want to do that, I have this guide for them.
